This is Mom Hood was so happy. You're here. Can it be Friday though? Seriously guys happy hump day know we're so excited for you guys to hear today's episode because we just sat down with Catherine McCord of Weelicious. You probably already know who she is. You're probably following her on Instagram. She has almost a quarter million followers on Instagram because she makes the most amazing lunches like Edible art. Yes. She also is the author of her third cookbook the Smoothie project. She is a Victorious Secret. Model former Victoria Secret model, but she still looks like a freaking model. I mean she'll just like floats in here, but she really gives us some amazing tips mostly of how to get your kids to be healthy eaters. Yeah, her kids walk around eating Kale like it's potato chips. It's very annoying to me. I started off the interview feeling like so intimidated and be like Oh and by the end there's all these really useful tips simple things that you can throw in a smoothie things for us Mama's for our hair and our skin and our nails keeping weight off staying fit staying healthy and then sneaky ways that you can add things for your kids. It's such there's so much take away in this interview. It's absolutely fantastic. It's also exciting because she talks about how exciting it can be to get your kids in the kitchen with you a part of the process from going to the store or the Farmers Market to making the smoothies and celebrating food. Yeah. Yeah, man, it's good. She's so great. I hope you love it. You ready? Yes. Let's do it. See Mom Hood Smurfette's funny. I'm going to start crying right now because I don't know why we're not doing this you're contemplating more than three. I've got three kids. So no, I'm done your condoms girl. Like there's no necessary reasoning but they're like number 3 number 4 lots of those. Yeah. I'm so freaking undecided to the point that like, we've got a little GuestHouse in the back and I've got all the kids, you know old clothing that I'm like, I she ","120":"should just donate it but I keep being like but then how annoying would that be if I have to rebuy it and I'm like why am I thinking that that means I'm obviously not done. Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. But you have to have for that's why I think I've talked about this before two or four buddy system. Oh, I don't junkie Gemma needs a buddy here. Jim is Buddy is going to be me and my only child it's because the other two are so old they're basically clones of me and my husband so it's like we usually just let them take care of her like she is like they they've always diapered her. To the bathroom what maker washer hand we so what are the ages of your kids? Well, almost 13 almost eleven and for its but my husband begged me. I didn't want a third. I was like, we're done boy girl. What's it worth? Yeah. She won the lottery. That's how I feel one year. He like begged me and then I was like, all right fine. You get one dry one month. Oh and the first time I got pregnant yet out eyes wait. So how have you found the experience to be with one being so significantly younger is it? Was it like and actually was kind of awesome or like man so magical so easy you can see all the windows you have babysitter or six their built-in babysitters. I think the only fear I have now, which I haven't had yet is that when the olders graduate because she's so obsessed with them. They're so obsessed with her. My husband's like stop it, but I do I'm like, you know what I mean? Because going to the buddy system like she will I mean, we'll say she'll then be an only child but she'll have friends not friends rhodolite. Yeah. We're not going to let you go down the I know I wrote that I took my head when I think about Millie and sunny. And first of all, did you know did you know that Brandi has this weird awful crowded dark side where she lets herself. Imagine like the worst kick like the worst case scenario if I'm dead when Millie has her first heartbreak psycho. I have to write a letter to her. I have two in my journal like I need to write a letter of how I want to respond to her. If she ever has her heart broken because what if I'm not there and I'm twisted she's no III just I have like I took my hat ","240":"you try to like silence them and you just think like oh my God, no one wants to like jump in either of our heads because it's like a dark. Okay. So I mean we're both pretty and they're both very sunny people that the internal dialogue is like, whoa, It's like a world of Darkness. I enjoyed that tremendously accurate but there's some dark in there. Oh, yeah. Oh my God, it's so good. I want you to jump in. I don't know how close these doors and so sighs I was just thinking about that because I was telling early how we met on the set of Guy's Grocery Games. Wait, was that the first time we met I think so. I mean was it not feel like it was in the makeup room when I got there. No, there's another say that I wasn't dead. I want to know how much sugar I was a guest on pop sugar. And then we did Guy's Grocery Games. I'm almost positive. I know that maybe it's the reverse. I know that you were at popsugar a couple times or at least once because Lisa sugar, yeah has a huge crush on you. And so everyone was all about you had to follow Weelicious. She's amazing and just like the hottest mom and who was it then? What either see this is I just remember like you know, so you guys probably are looking at Catherine right now. Although all of you are like following her on Instagram as you're listening, but she's gorgeous. She's stunning. She's a former Victoria's Secret model and but yeah, no exactly no big deal. She's just like, you know, two feet taller than on both of us, but I was telling orally that your spirit your beautiful soul. Totally just like proceeds your beauty like when you're in the same room is And you just feel this like halo around her because she's warm and genuine and just so lovely and like beautiful on the inside and outside. But I remember when I met you I was so nervous because I thought it was that Guy's Grocery Games and I'm like, oh my gosh, hopefully Katherine is nice and she can kind of like Mentor me because I'm kind of freaking out that I'm judging with her and I don't remember if Troy was the third like probably probably he's Troy. He's another hotel another judge on the food critic. Got it. Oh, yes. ","360":"also like mr. Love Boat like the sweetest sweetest. I've got married. I know just don't know. I know I've noticed it's really love about lying. I know I've like lots of chapter. He's gone through a lot of like highs and lows and then he just got married. I know it's really cute. But oh it don't we all do that like we're like show up to a new job and like I hope everyone's gonna be nice and that is when the Guy's Grocery Games is one of those things where everyone is I've never been with any what everyone's just like so kind open supportive. As it should be as it should be. Yeah, but it's not probably not. Yeah because we also bought it about babies because you had your all of your babies both your babies to have no I had two of them at home. Yeah. I mean you did. Yes. Yeah. Well I had the first in the hospital and it was I I just I had seen the business of being born when I was six months pregnant with my middle daughter and I was like, that's it. I'm going to Humber that my doctor was like what why that's like, why would you do that? And it was like the most magical experience in my life? Life so much that I did it again. And I mean I'm I'm just a big advocate of home birth or female choice. I think that that ugly it to I say that all the time women should do exactly what they want to do as long as they're informed and that's the problem but they shouldn't be guilted or Shane do not doing something that they want or doing something. They don't want to do looks so interesting to hear that both of you guys did it because before meeting Brandi who I feel like is a very like normal person told me I was the weirdest person ever. I always imagined like homebirth people to be like a certain kind of people like it's like they shave their armpits exactly. It seemed to me as this really like extreme outlandish thing. But now the more people that I know that I've done it it's come down to earth so much more because there's all these people who simplify it and make it and I'm like, oh, well, I didn't know that that happens. I didn't know that happens. Like I've learned so much that now I'm like I've now have a lot of friends that I've realized. ","480":"done it and all are very mellow normal level. They're not the kind of person I imagined it was just because we it was so foreign. I mean for me it was like being in my power like I think that it was tough for I was so stunned. Look I was in a hospital the first time and I was just scared. I didn't know I was told that like you just do what we say and all of a sudden I was like, wait a minute I can home birth and be in my power and do a nice a and trusting your instincts listening to your body but also having professionals there have under was Jeweler Midwife. Yeah, whatever. Oh, yeah. I had like, yeah. Midwife and the Doula but I remember for some reason we got on that topic within like an hour about us. Yeah, he likes kids didn't eat anything like exchanged a glance. I probably shouldn't do this, but I'm always like oh you're pregnant someone like I want to sway anyone in to land another same way. I always we talked about this once in my next life. I'm to your pregnancy coach. I love that though. I'll do anything. That's so amazing. Yeah, I think I remember the first time that I met you you were on home and family and I was telling Brandi I ended up naturally stumbling onto your insta and like being very upset because I was like, I can't do that. Like I'm the person that like lunch is like a package of Ritz crackers a yogurt a whole Apple II can't even be bothered to cut up the apple slices. I got my sucker can eat through that thing throw it in and I'm like love you we all did Look and I'm like, this is a work of art this is so well, first of all, it's so creative and that's the thing that I think like there was like a little soul connection there like the creativity of it and everyone has their things that they find where they're creative. But that was so your space and my creativity is so not in that product. That's nothing but at Road America Never Gonna live up to anyone who likes like any kind of like crafting I was looking at food is just like it's crafting but also, So ","600":"like because of the way that you present food, especially in the context of your kids. That's really encourage them to have healthy habits. Yeah. I try. I think that I mean there are rounded and I think that anyone's children can be like anyone can become a great eater. It's just a matter of like how food is presented to you and there's so many opportunities like but it does like look cooking feeding. Its 21 meals plus snacks every week. So like a mom's job a parent's job Annie. That's fact. You just said it's painful 21 meals plus snacks because we know that like every kid's I like under the age of things like a 10 a.m. And an after school snack and it doesn't go away. I mean it's it is daunting and it's like it especially if you don't like cooking or your don't like chopping and then they're like, I'm hungry. You're like again. Yes. Well, why won't go away this won't go away. Isn't it funny and couples? They always complain about what's for dinner? No, huh? I'm trying. They say that's like the number one argument every day. The couples have is what's for dinner. What's for lunch? What are we doing? Yeah, I'd love to ask. I'd love to ask this if you have any practical tips because so I love to cook but like grown-up food and my kids are really picky and I assume that that's I've obviously created that you know, it's a good time for me to sit here and be like Like this it's kind of my fault. Yep sucks sucks balls. So is there any like how have you created those habits in them? Is it the what we here which is like introduce the food this many times or the visuals like like what's a tip for other women listening who have a similar situation picky kids who are eating kids food what first and foremost every kid is different. So like there's just naturally those kids they're going to have different taste buds than other kids. So like Like much of it is behavior. So it's some like ","720":"eat this and kids were like, I don't want to eat that like so it's really the way that we interact with them about food and the relationship we have with food the relationship that we are the culture we have set about food in the home. Yep, and it's even like let's just take baby food. So you're feeding your baby and even at a young age, like are you constantly the one that's like here eat this Eat This and like shoving a spoon where they're like, even you know, four five six seven months old. Passive eaters they're not active eaters. So like I do like that like if you put like some rice little teeny pieces of rice or baby that they can learn to eat so that they're feeding themselves opposed to like you haven't eaten today. Like I would like parents, you know, they're like eat all your vegetables eat it all like they're not going to starve. They're not going to die like you there's and and kids stomachs are very different than ours. So like for the most part adults are always like they're always hungry. We are like emotional eaters. You know what? I mean, like you're always feeding your emotions where with kids it's different they their machine so they're like they really clue and like am I hungry? Am I not hungry and food is the most boring thing the kids that truck their friends like everything is more exciting than food. So starting certainly, you know anymore and we don't think about that like to pull them away from playing to eat is like torture torture and at lunch at school. Like if you've ever gone to just watch kids eat at school and they're like they When their lunch boxes and they immediately close them because they're like they're only given 15 minutes in school. I'm so over that this is why I want to home-school another reason why they don't have that much time. So, you know you open the lunch box. You're like then you're berating them. Why didn't you eat your lunch? I made this I bought this so I think that it's like it's really looking at all those 21 meals and looking what is how active versus passive. Are you making your child? How much? Did they even have in the activity of either buying growing ","840":"making and this is something Kevin that I've learned from you and I know a lot of you guys already follow her because we've shared a lot of the tips that she's had before on Instagram is the way that I've included million to cooking shopping. You know, she comes to the farmers market with me which I'd love to hear more about the role that it plays in your house because every Sunday you walk us through the hall that you have, you know gotten with your kids the meals that you play it and so forth, but that has been a game changer and I Doing that with Millie before she was one years old. I mean Chris made her the toddler's stole when she was like ten months. So she still couldn't walk and I would have her come with me the farmers market and taste everything try everything. We did baby LED weaning so she could pick things up and eat and then even when she could just like to transfer work like transferring the blueberry at that. She gives that this is a name. I'm a by the way, I like a bad swing blueberries. I like her fine motor Skills are now that she's too it's all about colors and shapes. And so when she's mixing with me or a measuring things, I have her help me do all of those things but that apps people say like, what's the secret to Mellie being good eater. She's involved in the entire process and she'll eat a bell pepper while I'm grocery shopping at the grocery store and I let her so, um, how did you really start implementing those habits with your kids? I mean for me from day one, like I've always been obsessed with farming and growing food. My grandparents did it so that was some of the modeling for me but like from day one with my son. I mean, I always went to the farmers market. So when as soon as I could like push him or like he was even in like when I was wearing him, I'd be like, you know just here tasting so I think that it's it is every little thing even if you live in a New York City tiny apartment. It's that you buy a little basil plant at Trader Joe's and you grow it together and then you decide like what are we going to make with it? Let's make some pesto with it. I think that it's it doesn't it'd have to be every meal. It's impossible. I mean, it's like even ","960":"me I have three kids. It's like attempting it but like they are around it. I'm always giving them the opportunity like whether it's like to to the to Choice method if you guys ever use that like you Selena, yeah. So the two Choice method is something like I think always brilliant. Do you want a carrot or do you want a cucumber do you want oatmeal or do you want a yogurt and you're always offering two choices, but those two choices always work for you. It is the parent like I There's two foods, but you're giving your child choice and you're not going to or you know offer something. Like do you want venison or ostrich? It's like you're waiting you have the liver but it's but it's all of a sudden instead of like here. Here's your meal where your kids like, you know, what here and shoves it back at you that I always called The Invisible middle finger. Like the drink it is just like God just like oh my God, that's so funny. I swear my son. Does that to me all the time? So yeah there yet. We tell them where to go to school what to wear who their friends are going to be everything. So the one thing that they can do with us is be like, I don't want it. Yeah and you're like, you're gonna eat it there. They can just give you that. Yeah, no invisible middle finger of like and that's because they know how to get you and once they see that in your face. Oh, yeah that you're like the fear that like you're not going to eat what I made or the other we like the other week. I had to go to the market and my husband wasn't home and I had the kids and you know, I'm like you guys want to go to market with me and my son goes do we have a choice? Listen, I'm goes then why are you asking he wasn't being a dick? Yeah, but he was such a dick. Yeah, and that moment like he wasn't trying to be was he didn't realize the tone. He was he was genuine. Like why are you asking ","1080":"we don't have a choice but like I looked at him and like so many feelings. I was just like dude in the car and we're going to get you think fun. Now. Let's see what I made is so funny how like invisibly get your goat. He had no idea but Korea for us. I'm telling you a Galaxy because food is the one thing that doesn't go away and it's so like we bring so much of our baggage into it, you know, right? Talk about all the time are still separating our story from their story not giving them our second hand baggage our secondhand stress. Totally. You mentioned Kenny you guys go to the farmers market still and when he was little and I know that the Smoothie project which you're currently getting ready to tour the United States promoting those things like third cookbook, but I didn't realize this so Kenya had some health issues and that's really kind of how the Smoothie project came about. Just so four and a half years ago. Go Kenya, I got was just here. I'll take it back. He became a vegetarian on his own when he was five years old. He we had gone to farm camp and my golly. What is Farm. Can I want to go to family and raising its in Upstate New York? It's literally kids go work on a farm and it's circle of life. So they do understand that like the baby pig won't eventually different different have a different path. Yeah, but it it's very much circled life, but he definitely has a predisposition to being a vegetarian even when he was a little he would you know, It was like the meat texture. I mean he would eat it, but he didn't love it. And once he was five interested, he realized that there was a choice to all of this so he is not his borderline vegan, but regardless he was eight and a half and he just started having horrible headaches horrible nausea, and this is the kid that like never complains like even if he's sick kills still be like I'm going to go to school. So this went on for months. It wasn't even like a day or two. So long time and I was like reading Nothing going to doctors nutritionists really just trying to figure it out. And then I had ","1200":"this book called Courier he kids with food and and I read this line and I read this line that said smoothies and it was just that's and that's literally all it said like you can try to smoothies. And so the next day I made this chart with little horrible pictures my little like chicken scratch drawings of fruits vegetables proteins with that everything you can imagine you would put in a smoothie and I gave it to him and I was like Make your menu make a smooth. Like what do you want? So I made a mistake move in the next day and we did it for three and a half weeks and within three and a half weeks all of his symptoms went away and it wasn't necessarily that like, you know, it's like smoothies are going to change your life. But what I realized and I that's not necessary true. They will change your life because it changed his life is because as a vegetarian I was the mom who was I love cooking? So I was like Crepes and waffles and pancakes and cheese quesadillas and his diet. Became cheese and bread and like even maple syrup or honey vanilla sugar and what he needed to start his day and what we do a lot in America and really all around the world this carbohydrates become the first thing we put in our bodies and then we're asking kids to like go to school and pay attention for 7-8 hours still fall asleep Focus don't fall asleep. And so when I first started like my husband had had a smoothie like that was like always his thing working six days a week six. No, long long days and he would leave the house every day and he likely said my smoothie and even with my pregnancy with Chloe and with Gemma I made this massive smoothie because I couldn't I just didn't want to eat a lot of other things and I knew I was getting the nutrients so all these stories and all these thoughts. I started like adding up and eventually I started getting more into like, I mean, we were having we've been having them every day and really how it started with Gemma was the one that was like, I mean, I was just doing it with Kenya Gemma was almost 10 months old I would put her on the counter because they're ","1320":"family. There's nothing the five of us like sitting around and she was just like bucking to get at our straw. So one day I just propped her up there and like 10 ounces like she just sucked it down and we were all dying laughing and so I like shared it on Instagram the next day and people were like It's the funniest thing in the world to watch and I realized like we're at baby food single foods. Like why aren't we like all of these like she could be having cake? Kale and spinach and strawberries and hemp seeds and all these brain building foods for even babies. And anyway, so I've worked with people from cancer with cancer all the way to older age and I started to realize like smoothies are just a great vehicle because they taste delicious. That's what I was going to say. Like, I love that. You're not talking about juices where you have to have and I'm talking about like green juices where you have to have a juicer you have to have like three pounds of greens to even make a dent like Talking about something that is so approachable to Middle America every household and you've talked about this before. I mean, it's almost like a milkshake, you know, I mean, it didn't like some of these recipes and you guys have got to get this cookbooks movie project so many interesting flavors that you're like, wait a second is this really like healthy for me Frozen cauliflower is is one that I've learned from you Catherine adding Frozen cauliflower to a smoothie just make it move. She's lying. In every smoothie, right? So like it really started with kids because I wanted my kids there were certain ones that like some kids are like it has to be pink. It has to be blue has to be purple you throw some greens in there. It's brown color is just different so Frozen cauliflower at make smoothies super creamy, you don't taste it and whatever color you're going for it like you're able to achieve so it became this like And it's a great hack for like people that are trying to lose weight. Wow, that's interesting to stay ","1440":"So you're like, oh I just ate like half a cup of cauliflower. Is it this team? Do you get the same effect if it's not Frozen? No, you want it to be frozen because you wanted it gives it that like creamy texture because when in the smoothies, is it something where everything is frozen so that it doesn't need ice and water down later. So you start with everything, right? So very few of my smoothies have ice because I'm looking back to your point about juicing. I'm looking for the fiber. So I want our systems to keep that's like one of the biggest problems with you know, the American diet is like what we eat and it just like combines in your stomach and we needed to like pass through and keep your intestines really healthy. So that fiber is essential so like this morning for breakfast. I made strawberry frozen strawberries a banana Frozen cauliflower hemp seeds chia seeds. I put collagen peptides but it was like bright pink and really sweet and delicious delicious and but now your cotton candy one. Yeah. Okay, she's good. Oh, yeah. I love it. Well, I guys I clicked on it. So I'm like, oh, yeah, I mean, oh my God dark side. No, it's like dr. Diver bags done with like Sour Patch Kids and with and know there's baby wipes in her somewhere the priorities of a mother so that you can see baby ones. Are there ingredients that like, let's say for the women out there who want to make smoothies for themselves that they want the benefits of maybe like beautiful skin or getting like hair, you know your hair to grow faster your nails whatever those things that are maybe more vanity focused for that side of them. Are there any ingredients that are like, okay, you always want to include XYZ all about the vanity. Okay? Yeah, it's all my see. My smoothies are all about the vanity ingredients. So collagen peptides every woman should be having their skin nails which we both have Berkeley. Peptides a hundred percent lots of companies are making and selling them now ","1560":"don't taste it. Yeah, but it's just pure protein. I'm a big believer in like hemp seeds or chia seeds because you need that fiber its protein and again their omega-3 fatty acids, which a lot of people really aren't getting and then the rest like come. I mean, there's so many other. Yeah. I mean, like if you're a vegetarian you should have a Brazil nut every day because I'm packed with selenium. So there's lots of like you don't what is selenium do well. It's just like an it's an essential item. Men that your body needs like, you know, when you take like an essential vitamin like the a multivitamin like you're probably peeing out much of that but you should know like for your body type to really like to really know. What are you defenseman? And what are you trying like are if you're trying to work on your hair skin nails your weight your you're like a lot of people aren't getting enough fiber. So like raspberries cup 4 cup have more fiber than any other fruit. So all those little seeds you want like little strawberries like have a lot of you Anything with seeds is fine. I didn't realize it would never have fan raspberries are low in calories. So if you're like, oh, I really want to like have everything delicious delicious fresh or frozen. Yeah what I like about making smoothies with Millie is that and you know, Katherine may have listed off a lot of ingredients. You guys aren't familiar with will make sure that we put her website down in the notes below but it's almost like this Buffet of fun different mix-ins. Like I love bee pollen. I love the way it tastes that goes into our smoothies Millie just discovered Goji berries. I don't know like six months ago, and she just thinks they're her own little Gummy Bears, you know, she never had candy, but I mean she just like so there's so many different ingredients that I think people just aren't aware of what would you say are like your top 10 like smoothie must-haves that people should of superfoods and toppings. So I mean, I always say like I keep shubin's and my freezer to pull out the fruits so because well because like if you have you know, like stacking Like where the heck is everything so if you take plastic shubin's you can always like rinse them down ","1680":"idea. I might just explode. Oh, yeah. Oh no. No, like everyone should like refrigerator. Organization is like so real so stop throwing away those brown bananas and lastly my husband. Mr. I always make smoothies. But yeah, you unpeel them and you have a hack for that too. Yes, I stick so whole bananas, especially for little eaters like under to you take your middle finger and you put it down the banana and it naturally goes into 3 pieces like into sticks and little ones can Hold them, but instead of like chopping bananas into coins. Yeah, would you like white and let's get skinnier than that of them up to door. There's a breeze bananas because then it makes it like Ice Cream. It's like nice craving naturally sweet. So, I mean my top ingredients would always be frozen bananas. I keep jars in my freezer just because to that and this will get gross. So if you have seeds or nuts, don't put them in your pantry because because you get so you'll get moths moths come from Wait, yeah a fucking minute ways. Tell you yesterday. No, I'm freaking out right out yesterday. I opened the pantry and a moth flew out and I was like, how did you get in there? Yeah when you get old and I have you get a hundred overnight. Well, I'm sorry. I want a true time. Don't open it. It's not true. Right now I want to do immediately is just so moths come from the grocery. It's like one mop will lay an egg inside they can get right in those plastic bags of like nuts seeds. All that so when you when you buy let's say hemp seeds just immediately jump put it in a drawer a jar put it in your freezer and within 10 days it kills anything. So you could even immediately then you can put it in your pantry if you want to I just keep justly guys. I just keep mine in my freezer because then you have like I put rice all my seeds nuts everything in my freezer in jars, and then they last I mean a year you can wow forever and then you can see them and they look nice. Yeah. So anyway, yeah, so I so bananas. Yep, and him seeds chia seeds bee pollen bee pollen is really ","1800":"in protein. If you buy it locally, it's great for seasonal allergies and it's an immunity booster. So I mean knock on Whittle always knock on wood when I say this, but my kids really don't ever get sick. It's very rare and I really attribute it to just like eating good the smoothies that they are, you know taking the bee pollen every day. I would think it's good to have an algae of some kind because like you don't get seaweed. They're like so nutrient dense. So there's Companies like III live that sells blue algae. It's called Blue Magic their spirulina. There's different kinds of allergies. You don't really taste it because especially when you're building your smoothies, you like those fruits that you're putting in they have such intense flavors and nutrients. Yeah, but it covers up like some of the other things that you're like, I don't know about if I'm gonna get a really like this really no, I mean it makes them look electric like they're at right blue teal like the ocean cord insane Argan fruit and me. I just might kill Always like whoa. I love that color. Not that they won't like chocolate peanut butter. Smoothie is still like one of their favorite but either human I'm yeah, but I put like all these great ingredients and I'm like, that's why there's a chapter in this movie Project cookbook. It's deserts movies. Yeah, they taste just like desserts but they're the secret is there they're really good for you. I just love that. You know that if you're making a smoothie which you do every single morning with your kids no matter what they do the rest of the day, you know that they have left the house. You'll do with really great whole ingredients that you guys made together and you like I think for you your parents like the book really is. No I need to I need to do that for myself because I'm one of those people who when I get stressed I forget to eat and so I'll start off the morning and I'll have a cup of coffee and I'll be running around I'm downtown buying materials doing shooting whatever and next thing goes for clock and I haven't eaten anything and so it's like having a smoothie that I could make in the morning that could start off my like being hungry because All stop for food if I'm hungry, but when I don't eat I don't get hungry. ","1920":"don't notice. I didn't eat and next thing. I know I'm like, why can't I focus on yeah and you're like Braintree. Yeah. I need to get this I think and having like when a cup that it's can stay, you know cold for 24 hours so that you can like, you know, if you're that person that's just like in and out of your car you really busy that you can sip on it. And at least you're like, oh my God, I just like my fruits my vegetables. I can go be naughty all afternoon and night and because I know that I like put all the essential foods and my body that I really need. Yeah, so I think that that's always I mean for me like and I yeah, it's I know a lot of people like skip breakfast and I'm always like it's the most important meal of the day. I did an entire like campaign about how important a just for the connecting. Yeah. It's such a confusing thing though because I'm watching The Today Show and they had on dr. Oz and I don't know like any I don't know anything about anything whether he's legit or anything, but if you have something like I don't know, yeah. He's on TV like whatever and he was talking about he was talking about the trend of intermittent fasting and he was saying the idea that breakfast is the most important meal of the day is just something that people that it's an idea that people said and ran with right if you you should eat when you're hungry and if you're not hungry in the morning don't eat the meal. It doesn't have to be the most important meal of the day. That's just something and so like then you hear that and then you're like it's confused and we are very different bodies and I do and what I subscribe to also is like if your I mean some of my kids are one kid is like could eat everything off this table and the other let you want. Are you talking about Gemma? Okay, Gemma and Kenya Gemma which is how a gymnast or my son. He's the saint. He's a huge breakfast person. Not a huge lunge person big dinner person and also depends on the last time the you ate haole, you're eating dinners for me. I'm more of the emotional side. I just love the connection Factor like sitting down with the kids and so forth and my philosophy. Even for me as I try to wait going back to the intermittent fasting ","2040":"I personally try to have 12 hours between when I had dinner and breakfast the next day so we tight end to be finished with dinner at 7:30. And I tend to have breakfast around 7:30. So, you know what? I mean? It's normal. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so and you know that makes sense, you know what I mean? So you because you're my husband things that you're like wait, I have been intermittent fasting. I just didn't realize it exactly like a new trend. I don't think 16 hours. I would be like uh-oh. Hungry, I get angry. So angry headaches. So let's talk about your Sunday mornings. When you go to the farmers market because we are so lucky here in Los Angeles that we have, you know access to so many amazing, you know farmers and produce and so forth. So kind of walk us through how important that Sunday is, but also I really want you to speak to the people that art, you know, so have that access to Great produce and so forth what you would say to them. So, I mean I've gone to the farmers market every Sunday for 20 years. It really is like where they're at 7:40. It's Church its connection to I mean, we are a family we help support. I mean a lot has happened over the years but it's the place that I got our food and I really, you know, I think I treasure that I look at as the food is medicine and the community that it offers us and it's just really a it is a beautiful experience and I can bring the kids and they I mean, they love goings. They have really deep relationships with all the vendors in the farmers. It's really sweet. Yeah, I mean, it's every Sunday every sin and to the point. I think you said it earlier like the farmers just like what do you want to try? Like they give them so much stuff. It's not my kids. It's just the farmers have and the way that they are were born and raised as to like feed so they want to see this next generation of kid. There's nothing cooler than seeing a kid like grab a mushroom or grab a their first taste of Persimmon. And you know even babies have you know, almost 20,000 taste buds. And as ","2160":"get older your taste buds diminish and that's why when you hit like your 40s 50s 60s as if you taste less you want things hotter spicier saltier, whereas with babies, you know, it taste of something sweet. It's like slowing. Wow, and that's but that's also why greens are so bitter like it's like like that's why you're a lot of kids are like, I don't want like things that are herbaceous or like like they just green means it's Instinct and bitter and it's super better. So, you know, that's why I like smoothies become a great way to like eat your greens because it's going to taste lovely instead of like how your throat isn't let's hide these vegetables in there and I love that because there's also an educational component when your kids are with you at the farmers market where they're learning about the produce their meeting people, but some of the ingredients that we have here are just insane, you know, you would think you would never be able to get those like where I'm from In Sierra Vista, Arizona on the border of Mexico what like the closest like dig stores like 80 miles away Louisville, Kentucky. There was Persimmons there and I mean, I remember getting the California and being like whoa, like strawberry guava and like what is a persimmon and there's nine varieties of things right in front of me and we are lucky. I do always suggest like like if you have a farmers market no matter how small it is try going because you're going to get to try something that's like really seasonal grown locally. Buy organic when you can, I mean Trader Joe's is you know, Walmart, they're both great companies that are trying to offer more Organics. You don't have to be perfect. If you can't afford it by a few things by just apples when they're in season organically because they're going to cost less. That's I mean that's always because I know that we all have food budgets also, you know, seeing what like fits in like what you can grow with your gorgeous lemon tree and I'll write the yard. I mean, I have so much fomo I'm just like so gnarly it's amazing. Yeah, ","2280":"gonna be if every time we record like that cat over that house. No matter what. You're not leaving without X Y or Z. Well, I get a little I get intense I get there I get there before the bell rings when it's like all Chef I'm going to show up on a Sunday. I'm going to skip it Church. I'm gonna meet you. It's real. It's really fun. She has like the most dry enormous Waggin Waggin. Okay, I see that on your and it's yeah, it's definitely it's like yeah, I my next Endeavor is like creating the perfect Farmers Market cart because yeah, it's real. Oh my God you need to well, I know because there aren't that many even my favorite one from The Container Store they don't they discontinued. So I have one from Fear Cruiser which is like well, yeah, I call it the Wolves rise. Yes. It's definitely one of those that's amazing. Yeah, yeah. Yes, you can put kids in it. You can put food in it. It goes over sand exact. Okay, I'm gonna reach out to them. So it's just like everything it's just always full and what I love about the farmers market for saving money to is that like I can just buy one of something and then I have my it's there's a no way so there's no waste and I really get frustrated like a grocery stores when you have to commit to a six-pack of zucchini and everything's wrapped. Why is it wrapped? The plastic wrap how long your travels like farmer's markets are and ","2400":"of the farmers though. Like, you know, if they've got too much of something don't give it to you for a deal. It's a give-and-take so like for us we don't really have waste and that is what I you know, I really love I do my best to try to meal plan through the week, but you know because I hate having anything left over but you know, it helps at the farmers market that you can just buy what you need. Yeah in your book you're talking about smoothies that correspond. With the age and where your child is developmentally. Can you guys give us examples based on your kids ages? What best smoothies that they should be having right now. So I also like look at the first all the kids are such different eaters and different profiles like Gemma like we have the chocolate peanut butter. She's super committed to it. She's like cookies and cream like give her the ones that have the names and then my older kids are Mike. That's basically they'll have anything. So I think that like one of my kids is really Slim. And I'm always just track calories calories calories. So I have to like focus on getting like nuts and seeds and like coconut oil and like any kind of healthy fat. I possibly can in there, you know for like me or you know, I'm you know, I'm I don't necessarily need that profile. But I mean like it's more like what what works for your taste for your age, but I do think like going back to like as many omega-3 fatty acids. Can be getting in your kids because like proteins so they stay full at school and making it delicious. That's why I like I wrote the book in the first place and going back to your point about like putting ice in like you it's like ice you don't you almost don't want to water it down. You just want those like Rich delicious flavors just like when you go to a place and get a smoothie or like I hope they're not putting ice in it because I'm paying for like the cruise. That's so true. Yes, that's so true. And that's why it's the 28th day smoothie project because I've seen with so many people that I've Earn it with and put on it like how their health changed within 28 ","2520":"of just making a commitment. It's just a smoothie. It's not like but like leave whatever your morning breakfast is and just have a smoothie for 28 days and I guarantee you will start to see some sort of change within your body. It's pretty miraculous and it's just a smoothie for breakfast. It's not like smoothies. It's not easy is all day. Yeah. Slurping all day long, but it's really like satisfying there's something that's so delicious. It becomes sort of a religion and I think there's something incredibly psychological because I mean how how often you have like vegetables for breakfast or even on my honeymoon when I was in Greece, you know anyways, but that's only when you're somewhere else and you're like, oh what's on the menu? No, I want a Greek salad. I want Tomatoes. I want you to um cucumbers you want like but no here in the US its eggs bacon maybe avocado. So I think that psychologically if you're able to be like high-five on me for getting all of these like nutrient dense foods and my body first thing it's set your course for the rest of your day really differently also and there's plenty of like I said going back to like the desert smoothies like you we make them for there's nice cream. They're like you can make so you mean even for dessert sometimes the kids will you know after dinner, they'll be like kind of smoothie and make sure why not. So if you're a green juice if you like more tropical, Favors if you're more like I want berries, so there's either a there's a chapter there's a recipe and it really breaks it down like the most important ingredients and like if you're trying to change your health if there's something going on in your body, you know, ADHD is a big one. And so we I've worked with you know kids with ADHD to make sure that they're because there are certain foods that kids shouldn't eat. It's almost like an allergy so the like a triggers and yeah. Yeah, so that's it's a really important venture. You're able to like kids with ADHD. They shouldn't for the most part ","2640":"like Brad like having car but got kind of a carbohydrate. It's just it doesn't it doesn't because it turns right into sugars in your body. So it's there's certain foods that you know, you want to watch that are more triggers and you want to watch out for are there any like things that are the only thing I can think to explain is like a fish oil or do you have like a set of oils that you add in that? Yeah for the moms. Yeah. Mikey change the flavor was really get that like fish burp that you all do like DHA or Oils. You can do MCT oil. Oh Cameron most of my family cameras that can MCT oil obsessed human. Yeah, but so like putting and I mean, it's like a really good for you fat because that's the other thing. I think a lot of women like only men like you need to eat like having and a smoothie is very easy to digest so you don't feel like bloated in the morning and heavy. It's just like Makes you still feel spout but you need to eat these cells sniffles all I know but I love that because then with the with the greens and the vegetables and the hemp seeds and all the things like if you weren't putting it in a smoothie how the hell would you like? That would be like a 45-minute morning routine to like take your drops of MCT and your collagen it just chucking it. All carriers like isn't there some Science behind the fact that those are carrying those nutrients to the rest of your body and that sometimes some TP absorption. Okay vitamin you when you eat iron people, you know, you always hear people are anemic like iron iron iron, but you have to have a vitamin C food to help the iron absorption in your body. So like if you hadn't if you eat an iron food like you have spinach or kale your if you don't have a vitamin C food with it, it's your body won't absorb the nutrients so he's a little crazy. So like kayln strawberries that works because there's vitamin C and Scale and I also that's what I mean. There's a lot ","2760":"like funny science to it all but you're like that's why I wrote a book and again like fats like in there like good for you fats, not the like hydrogenated oils. We're looking for just like the MCT on the xct oil x y-- t-- o-- x CT and MCT. Well there it's feel free. Yeah, it's funny. It's like I'm per time pretending these are show notes, but this is literally just behind There's gonna be nothing in the description. This is one of the biggest my new shop is luckily the book. It does break it all down what all the ingredients you could have should have it. So it's not it's not a and I don't want people to like, I'm very conscious like either money conscious like picked a few things like check in with your body read the book and be like, oh I need these four things. You know what I mean with this. Oh, this is like I'm going to try this smoothie like yeah, I my family because this is like what I do and what I love We have a different smoothie every day, but it's not that big a deal like yeah to get a few of the extras and you have like a bag of strawberries about your frozen blueberries, you know, and you can use I mean Frozen is your best friend. It's a huge cost saver and it's there at the ready. It's not like I run out to the gross. What I like to do is like any time that you know, either at the farmers market like you said a lot of farmers as so, you know, when it's closing time if they have excess fruit and produce its marked down they'll give it to you and a lot of times it's super right. The best time to just pop it in the freezer totally. Oh, yeah, I freeze everything anytime. Something's Gonna Go bad. I'm so do you usually buy fresh and freeze or do you buy freezer like things that are in the front? I'm actually the lazy girl. I'm go right to the Whole Foods 365 Trader Joe's and I just buy all the big bags of Frozen everything. Okay. Awesome. Oh, no, this is like, I mean the Smoothie projects like no guilt. Yeah easy to keep on hand and you can it doesn't have to I mean and when it comes to milk so it can be like almond milk. I mean shockingly surprisingly. Email that has the most protein of any of the plant-based milk. What is by the way ","2880":"tastes great. Yeah. So Ripple is a company that makes p milk but like women milk isn't just Greenpeace. It's between peas, you know, yeah, I have to buy a book your face. What are the two of you talking about right now? It just tastes like it's like, you know, there's oat milk. There's no it's fight. It's totally white. I promise. I promise. Oh my gosh, next episode. I'm gonna make you want to Catherine smoothies and then I'll give you a shot of the penal shouldn't we do like we do milk tastings at my house. Like it's we get real nerdy because some with your kids are guessing what it is that is actually and talking about getting kids excited to try new foods like any time you can to surprise taste tests kids. Love it like turning food into a game only you know that you see a smoothie and it happens to be green like that's what it is, but it tastes different it tastes. Be green, but I guarantee it taste like raspberries or strawberries if that's what you put in because that flavor profile will mask any of those grand if they're into almond butter peanut butter just scoop of that. All right? Exactly. And that's why I mean raspberry peanut butters. Yes, that's what I mean. I do like cocoa powder and a scoop of peanut butter and chocolate peanut butter smooth. He's always and a chocolate almond butter or whatever but being able to pick your milk or or it could be herbal tea or it could be water or coconut water so you can kind of make I mean the book has All of the different liquids you can use but it just depends on everyone's already putting in their Prime car. I know I love that. We know a little bit about your morning routine, but I would love to know more mmm because early and I talked about this and I've shared this with our listeners how Mr. And I wake up early before our kids we did this when we were newlyweds me this when we had a newborn Millie and now we have two kids. We always make sure that we wake up before our kids so we can have quiet time together so he can go to the gym I can Journal. I don't really do the Thing loves to journal in the morning. Can you walk us through what your morning routine is like ","3000":"the both of you. I'd like to be Journal. I know you got that third kid. It's a good job. I didn't even mention 1110. Like I would say like it doesn't have to be dinner like breakfast whatever meal you can attempt to like sort of be together. And then yeah the many other Beauty things are work out things. I don't work out because I wasn't sure. Yeah, I never loved working out. I love it so much. But I've just been in this place in my life that I've just been I really can't fit it all in so work is pretty pretty intense. But I do think that there are like stages in your life and like I choose family and friends right now over that hour of exercise. Eyes because I work so much that I I need something to fill my soul. And yeah that that part is like the family and friends, but I'll get back to this season for everything. Yeah, like I think that that's actually great and like it's great advice and this is something we've talked about a lot on the podcast and something I've learned so much from Brandy is the idea of like if you're making a decision like I'm not working out you're not saying like yeah, it's like no I'm choosing other things. It's like you're being purposeful about it. So it reduces any kind of guilt or shame around that thing because your Like it's not that I every morning trying I don't you like no. No, I'm prioritizing other things. There's other things. I'm getting that are making me feel good. And that's what I'm doing right now. Yeah, so it just takes away the story because I think that that's something that people struggle with is if they don't I don't I don't have the time right now. I feel like to work out either and and it's like you can get yourself in this cycle where not only does your body not feel good because you're not working out, but now mentally you're punishing yourself about it and it becomes this it takes on a life of its own. Yeah, and I found I mean, I like luck. Lee I'm I still feel the same and I think that's because I do things ","3120":"my kids like we do dance parties are all like I mean, I have a four-year-old so it's like a lot of stairs and a lot of carrying and like someday like shooting last week. I like carrier for 2 hours and the next day I was like my whole body is like a hammer and I realize like I had worked it out all day. So I think you know I take the stairs and parking them the the spot, you know on the other side, you know instead of the clothes spot. I try to do all these like sort of more bill. It's and natural things as much as possible. Yeah, actually the this is like sort of off topic but not because it's part of your story when you were Victoria Secret model. What was your speaking of ugly? My daughter just came running out of room. What was your like internal dialogue around Health Food Fitness, was it always very like healthy like a healthy mindset around these things I ever did that come because yeah, I mean, I've always been had a healthier mindset, but I What not lie that it's like being around the vortex of girls who are it's a hundred percent about your body and your face. It's pretty intense. It's pretty painful. I mean I came from like just eat and yeah from the sound, you know what I mean, totally like such a celebration totally and I really did like my fresh food real food. I mean, we definitely had the like KFC drive-through was a very interesting time growing up, but that's what I mean like I exercised. So much in my life that I don't want to exercise anymore now, like I think it might have enough like muscle memory and I think that it's it was a challenging time being around that but it made me realize like my feeling of food like it's to be celebrated and you know, it's to its to feed your engine opposed to feeling your feelings. So I think that that's been like, you know that it means it's a full circle. It's very like it is interesting. Yeah, can I find that so fascinating? I love that idea of like fueling your ","3240":"I think it's also important to recognize too that all of us were raised, you know a certain way and we had our relationships our parents had a specific relationship with food a lot of us. It was like finish your plate. You have to finish eating this, you know, you can't have this you can't have dessert without this and that's one thing that I always talk about because I want Millie and Sonny to have healthy relationships with food is not that nothing is given as a reward, you know, so like even even when I put the homemade cookie beside her with dinner or there on the table, she will still nine times out of ten. She was still finished her broccoli and the rise send the turkey and then she'll start on her cookie. Yeah, I mean it's and I think that this is something important for our listeners to realize is that there is so much power and how we model the relationship that we have with food, especially when it comes to things that are naughty or things that we've been programmed to think are bad. Well, I mean, especially in this social media generation like raising two girls and not that it doesn't affect boys, but I do think that like body image and having a very healthy like having a healthy relationship with food for me like with my because my mean like my mom was always like she cooked for three we were for like she would be like and what you know, she would she did and she was always running and I remembered all this and I think that we as mothers have a really important job and that is not to like look if you're feeling a little like, you know not Not don't pinch your side and be like, oh Mom. I like her. Oh, I feel bloated. Like your kids are like they're listening. This modeling is so important. So all I talk about always is just like feature engine and you know, did you know there's your mind feel sharp and like tasted like I want my kids to really understand that like food is just like this beautiful gift that we all get to feed our you know to feed ourselves in to be a community like to eat dinner together. So I think that is so many layers to it. Sign language is a calorie or it yes, you know is a means to an end or ","3360":"Yeah, and I'm be mine. Let my kids like I mean, they're the Halloween or like we have dessert like every night I offer but it doesn't mean that it's well, even if you're like potato box and there's so much we could cover. Sorry. I don't know what I know. I mean, I feel like we could have you on like five more times and just without dedicating her story one potato box, but talked about how one potato box. There's always desert included in your meals. Yes. Sorry company one potato. It's an organic family friendly food company you get two or three Camille's they take 10 to 20 minutes to prepare start to finish in every box you get a free roll of homemade cookie dough out. It's all there - so good so and the flavor changes every week, but I believe that you may have a slice and bake cookie. You should have a guy mean you got one roll of cookie for cookie dough for two or three days. It's I mean, it's like it's like you can get ya 6 8 cookies out of it. But the point is like you should enjoy it like you don't have to eat the whole roll and like have a cookie. Yeah. So trade about you is like you have several Brands and your So true to who you are and every single thing that you do and talk about, you know, there's this beautiful balance and and one thing that I wanted to ask you in this interview because you talked about this a lot is making time for each of your kids because as you guys know early and I we have two kids so there's been there's one in one of us, but I know but you always make time that your you always make it a priority to have one-on-one time with your kids so much so that you even take trips with them. Yeah one-on-one. How did you get to that? Place and how did you even recognize that that was something important to do with your children? So that was modeling my parent parents. My mother always took me to I mean, they didn't have the finances to be doing anything luxurious, but they definitely saved to go on these trips every summer. So I get to go for like a week and a half two weeks. My mom would take me to like France or London or Germany or like anywhere traveling and it's all I remember like if you ask me like what how was school in seventh grade? I'm like, but I remember every second of those trips. The connection because I think that especially in this digital age our brains. ","3480":"mean our kids weren't like we're also fried and so all over the place. So I started when my daughter was eight years old and I took her to Paris the next summer took her to Paris and London and then this summer took my son to Iceland and we go for a week and I work in an igloo and the Blue Lagoon and sing anybody he was in vegan Heaven. It was the best was the best that we just drove around. We just drive around in a look a 12 year old boy and his mother, you know, it's like Like but we just we connect we played games at dinner. We just talk in bed. And like I think that having that slow like one-on-one connection that you can look forward to just every year but it almost feels like these Farmers Market trips and making smoothies together those Traditions evolved into something bigger with the trip. So, you know, if someone's listening is like, oh my gosh, I can't even imagine doing that right now and saving for all that. There's so many other things you guys did one on one with yours. Just a walk. That's just our relationship. Remember when I was younger my parents used to do dates where my dad my mom and my dad would each take us on separate dates also, and I remember like it was it was it was the same thing. I remember like the where we sat in the restaurants like super Vivid memories of these dates that we had especially with my dad and my mom was so funny. She put the kibosh on it because every time my dad would take us out women thought that he was like divorce. I have like it was his day with the kids so he would get hit on like that's over. Sometimes we're just I'm scared because he's getting taught my son's game or it's gonna be ","3600":"my little boyfriend boyfriend boyfriend that reminds me of when I asked my husband to do something for me and he like takes forever says no and I'm like if I was Millie, you would have done it. Oh, I like that act like wait a second. I was little things like just want water just got her in bed. Yeah. I'm like Millie last for more water. I'm Dolly dollies hat with all these things before bed and like I'm just like In part because I'm nursing our child, but will someone get it for you? Yeah. She know I said, yeah, that's hilarious. Oh my god. Oh go go go. I had a question about a product because I feel like I see it in your Instagram and I don't know if it's a set one but The Lunchbox is so after watching you do it. I got all excited and thought for a minute that I would and so I went on Amazon and I looked for like bento box lunch boxes and the one that I bought sucks so much because it's so shallow. That I can't like really fit like I'd have to cut everything. So tiny. I want to know if I'll show you I'll show you here. But so I wanted to know if there's one that you can recommend that we can link that is has the has it divided so you can do them but also has enough space that you're not cutting everything into these like little itty bitty. Yeah quarter-sized bite. I know it I already doing you have I'm gonna I can visualize okay. I like Planet boxe. It's because it's stainless steel. I can give you like it's yeah stainless steel. So it's actually because most of them We'll say like dishwasher safe. But is it safe for your dishwasher or safe for you? Like they're not really so a lot of them are made with plastic. Oh, yeah, this one is stainless. So you can easily wash it out. My son has had his for seven years. So the price point is like, you know on the I think they're about like with the case and everything. It's like 50 some odd dollars. So that's like an it's an investment but he's had I mean, my kids have had them. Oh my God, they've had them for years and you open it up and you have all of your choices. So, you know, where as I said like, you know sometimes It's like if they if they stick their hand in the brown paper bag and pull out a cookie. It's the cookie but ","3720":"way they open and they're like, oh like their body tells them in such a different way than adults bodies tell them so that they won't grab the red bell pepper or the Cucumber the strawberries, you know, and it was so and it has also better than just having a whole bunch of different containers because they can see the choices right in there. They can see the colors everything's together and half of the time when you're taking off lids and things like you're just wasting time kids will never get to everything so one. Container open it up. There's all your choices and it's just like and teachers will love you teachers love a Bento Box because they don't have to like deal with all those containers everywhere. Yeah and all that excess waste. No, I was just going to ask you what do you want our listeners to know about the Smoothie project? And if you could encourage them to implement one thing a day besides the smooth ER, you know, what do you want them to know about this project? I think that it's just really about health and changing your health and making a goal. I mean as we head in The holidays in January and people like everyone says I'm going to overeat and you know, I really want like people to start by January 1st, January 2nd make January your smoothie project where you're going to make that desire to like enjoy eating. This is not a diet. It is not like deprivation. This is like heat and low lighting at the end of it be like I ate like exactly what I wanted and More in 28 Days Later something is different in my body. And make it a discovery of like God. I like my hair is shinier. My skin is better my I've been so bloated and now my eyes feel spelled covering all of these new ingredients that might not even know. It's like going to Whole Foods finally or whatever Grocery and being like Oh, I now I know what to do with that stuff totally because it is it's like a cannot you're like, I it's so overwhelming. Well, yeah. Yeah, so being able to like break it all down it. Like pick one or two things that you know, you are changing changing your health and "}}}
